Replace the placeholders with the actual staking contract address, contract ABI, and user's Ethereum address. Additionally, replace "your-private-key" with the user's private key.

Ensure that you have the Web3 dependency installed. You can install it by running the command npm install web3.

Please exercise caution and ensure that the staking contract address and user's staking information are accurate before executing the script. Make sure you have a valid private key to sign the transaction and claim the rewards.

Note that this script serves as an example and may require customization based on your specific staking contract or desired transaction parameters.
